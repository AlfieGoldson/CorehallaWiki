## Moveset Terminology
### Light Attacks

- [Weapon] **Neutral Light** *(abbr. **NLight**)* - the attack performed by pressing the light attack button while standing on the ground and not pressing a direction or, in certain configurations, holding up.
    > Ex: Unarmed Neutral Light *(abbr. Unarmed NLight)*
- [Weapon] **Side Light** *(abbr. **SLight**)* - the attack performed by pressing the light attack button while standing on the ground while holding left or right.
    > Ex: Hammer Side Light *(abbr. Hammer SLight)*
- [Weapon] **Down Light** *(abbr. **DLight**)* - the attack performed by pressing the light attack button while standing on the ground and holding the down button.
    > Ex: Sword Down Light *(abbr. Sword DLight)*

### Light Aerial Attacks

- [Weapon] **Neutral Air** *(abbr. **NAir**)* - the attack performed by pressing the light attack button while airborne and either not pressing a direction or while holding up.
    > Ex: Unarmed Neutral Air *(abbr. Unarmed NAir)*
- [Weapon] **Side Air** *(abbr. **SAir**)* - the attack performed by pressing the light attack button while airborne and holding either left or right.
    > Ex: Spear Side Air *(abbr. Spear SAir)*
- [Weapon] **Down Air** *(abbr. **DAir**)* - the attack performed by pressing the light attack button while airborne and holding the down button.
    > Ex: Katar Down Air *(abbr. Katar DAir)*

### Heavy Attacks

> **Signature** *(abbr. **Sig**)* – same as **Heavy Attack** when holding a weapon. Each Legend has six unique Signatures.
- [Legend] [Weapon] **Neutral Signature** *(abbr. **NSig**)* - the attack performed by pressing the heavy attack button while standing on the ground and not pressing a direction or, in certain configurations, holding up. This will be one of the Legend's signature moves if holding a weapon.
    > Ex: Ada Spear Neutral Signature *(abbr. Ada Spear Nsig)* Spear Nsig or Ada Spear NHeavy.
- [Legend] [Weapon] **Side Signature** *(abbr. **SSig**)* - the attack performed by pressing the heavy attack button while standing on the ground and holding left or right. This will be one of the Legend's signature moves if holding a weapon.
    > Ex: Scarlet Lance Side Signature *(abbr. Scarlet Lance SSig)*
- [Legend] [Weapon] **Down Signature** *(abbr. **DSig**)* - the attack performed by pressing the heavy attack button while standing on the ground and holding down. This will be one of the Legend's signature moves if holding a weapon.
    > Ex: Cassidy Hammer Down Signature *(abbr. Cassidy Hammer DSig)*

### Heavy Aerial Attacks

- [Weapon] **Recovery** *(abbr. **Rec**)* - the attack performed by pressing the heavy attack button while airborne and not holding down. This move is useful when trying to recover (get back to solid ground) after being knocked off the stage, thus the name. This move has limited uses.
    > Ex: Sword Recovery *(abbr. Sword Rec)*
- [Weapon] **Ground Pound** *(abbr. **GP**)* - the attack performed by pressing the heavy attack button while holding down in the air. This move will typically travel straight downwards until the attack button is released or until meeting the ground or an opponent.
    > Ex: Spear Ground Pound *(abbr. Spear GP)*

##  Community Terminology
These are terms commonly used by the community to describe certain events or situations in the game

- BMG is Blue Mammoth Games, developers of Brawlhalla.
- Community Color, or CC, is a special color (blue, gray, and orange-yellow) only unlockable with codes given at developer giveaways, for great contributions to the community (finding bugs, creating tutorials or fanart, and more), or as award for winning certain tournaments.
- Metadev is a skin unlockable only with codes given away at events that involve the developers of Brawlhalla in the flesh (thus the name, “Met A Dev”). Currently, the only such skins are the Metadev Orion and Metadev Brynn.
- Malhalla is the built-in Brawlhalla store, where you can unlock Legends and purchase skins, taunts, and avatars.
- Salt is frustration and anger caused by gameplay or gameplay events. A losing player who becomes angry with the winning player is often called “salty.” This term has its own taunt, which tends to induce this emotion in many players.
- Tilt is when a player enters a continual losing streak. Often self-perpetuating, tilting is typically caused or exacerbated by impatience, frustration, and anger during play (the “tilted” state), which usually leads to even more losses. A typical piece of advice for a tilted player is to calm down and take a break if possible.
- Spam is when a player uses the same move over and over. Most commonly used for players who repeatedly use a single signature attack over and over which is commonly considered a poor fighting strategy. Many losing players tend to accuse their opponents of “spamming,” sometimes without any actual reason.
- Calculated is a remark often said to describe an amazing combination of skill and precision, very often involving the Mine. More often than not, a “calculated” moment is just lucky positioning: however, experienced players sometimes try to actually calculate such combinations with careful mine placement or bomb throws.
- Pulling a zee or just zee is a term used when a player kills themselves for no apparent reason, generally from misjudging platforms, miscounting jumps, or a combination of the two, resulting in a free or early stock for the opponent. Named after player ZeeZombie, who became infamous for doing this during several well-watched tournament bouts.
- The Crockie or crockie ball is an alternate term for the Spike Ball gadget, named after player Crockie after he became known for continual skilled and inventive use of the gadget during gameplay.
- Black hole is a combo executed by two players to juggle a third player back and forth between them continually, most often using the same moves over and over with good timing. If spaced correctly, the trapped player has no opportunity to dodge or move away between the hits, and continues to accumulate damage until a final strike with a different move knocks the doomed victim off the stage. A black hole requires a significant degree of coordination between the two players, and therefore most commonly seen in 2v2 matches.
- Stardust Tech is a certain way of bomb juggling (throwing it upwards and catching again) used to bait out dodges and/or create opportunities for your own bomb throw. This term was coined after player ThStardust consistently pulled off this tech in multiple games in a row during the second WEB Grand Tournament. Examples: [1][2]
- Tybo Dodge is when a player dodges into an opponent at a sub-optimal time, causing them to be punished – usually in a very bad way. It was coined after player Tybo, who used to do it all the time.
- Pulling an egg is when a player misses a large tournament by sleeping in for too long. It was “popularized” by player eggsoup, who did this all the time, even for important games.
Weapon Starving is when a player throws weapons off the map and/or keeps players away from dropped weapons in an effort to make their opponent barehanded.
- Russian Mafia is a peculiar and very effective Hammer combo when you lift the opponent in the air with the stomp (dLight), jump and grab him in mid-air with the Recovery to smack on the ground. This is often complimented by grabbing the rebounding enemy with the dAir to launch him up in the sky, which often results in a knockout.
- Bread-and-butter attack is a term used in this wiki to describe an attack (usually a Signature) that is versatile enough and can be used in a variety of situations.
- Lingering attack is when an attack (usually a Signature) “hangs” in the air for some time after the initial burst or swing, and can still damage enemies who happen to run into it (unlike the attacks that can hurt the enemy only for a frame or two). The most noticeable lingering attacks in the game are Azoth's Forward and Down Bow Signatures, which can damage enemies with fading-out flames.
- Active Frames is the duration of your attack’s hitbox (i.e. the number of game frames during which the attack can hurt you). Active frames are preceded by start-up frames (charge-up time), and followed by recovery frames (recovery time) -- the character is vulnerable and usually cannot hurt/move during charge-up and recovery times.
Cooldown is additional delay between using the same move two or more times in a row. Makes spamming a single attack over and over a very bad idea.

## Tournament Terminology
- BCX is the Brawlhalla World Championship. More details here.
- A game is defined as the instance of combat where the outcome is determined by a team/player losing all their stocks.
- A set is defined as the best-of-3 or best-of-5 games that is played until a team/player has won a majority of the set. (Multiple sets are only played in the case of the lower seed team/player winning a set in the Grand Finals.)
- A match is defined as the set or collection of sets wherein a team/player has officially lost and the winning team/player advances to the next round of the Tournament.
